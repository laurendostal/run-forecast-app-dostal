Users must log in or sign up to access Run Journal features.  After accessing an account, users are able to input data including the date, time, distance (required) of a run, as well as the elapsed time, location, and weather conditions.  These weather conditions include temperature, feels like temperature, and humidiity.  As a longtime runner, I recognize how important tracking these elements of runs are for improvement.  Logging workout stats promote motivation and imrrovement, as they are able to give insight on progresss and different conditions that may be affecting an individuals workout.  Conditions like temperature, feels like temperature, and humidity can influence athelete preformance or change the outcome of a run.  Users are able to look up current weather conditions based on location to supplement their workout log.

Below the workout log input form is a section of the site that allows users to get current weather by searching the name of city and its country code.  An example of a valid search input would be "Orlando, US" to get the current weather data in the city of Orlando in the United States of America.  The search output lists the city, time, temperature, feels like temperature, and humidity of the user's searched location.
